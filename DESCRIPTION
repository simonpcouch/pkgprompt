Description: Information in a large language model's prompt is analogous to 
    its short-term memory; models will provide more informative answers
    on problem contexts that they've been prompted on, even if the same 
    information was in the training data. This package converts R package 
    documentation to LLM-readable plain text to facilitate passing it as part 
    of a prompt.
